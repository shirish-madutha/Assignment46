    "\"\"\" \n",
    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of regression analysis used in machine learning and \n",
    "statistics, but they serve different purposes and are suited for different types of problems. Here are the key\n",
    "differences between linear regression and logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependent Variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Linear regression is used when the dependent variable is continuous and numeric. It predicts \n",
    "a real-valued output based on input features. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square\n",
    "footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary or categorical, representing\n",
    "one of two classes (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no, spam or not spam). It models the probability of an observation\n",
    "belonging to a particular class. For example, predicting whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0) based on\n",
    "various email features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Output Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Linear regression produces a continuous output, typically a real number. The predicted values\n",
    "can be any real number, including negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Logistic regression produces a probability score between 0 and 1. This score represents the\n",
    "probability of an observation belonging to the positive class. It can be converted into a binary prediction using\n",
    "a threshold (e.g., if the probability is greater than 0.5, classify as class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression Use Cases: Linear regression is suitable for problems where the target variable is continuous \n",
    "and the goal is to predict or understand the relationship between input features and a numeric outcome. Examples\n",
    "include predicting sales revenue based on advertising spending or predicting a person's weight based on their \n",
    "height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression Use Cases: Logistic regression is suitable for classification problems where the goal is to\n",
    "predict the probability of an observation belonging to a particular class. It is widely used in binary \n",
    "classification tasks, such as spam detection, disease diagnosis (e.g., presence or absence of a disease), \n",
    "and customer churn prediction (e.g., churn or not churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a medical research project to predict whether a patient is at high risk (1) or low\n",
    "risk (0) of developing a specific medical condition based on various patient characteristics and test results\n",
    "(e.g., age, family history, blood pressure, cholesterol levels). In this scenario, logistic regression would be\n",
    "more appropriate than linear regression because the outcome is binary (high risk or low risk), and you are \n",
    "interested in modeling the probability of the patient falling into one of these two categories. Logistic \n",

    "Forward Propagation: Compute the predicted probabilities (y_hat) for all training examples using the current model\n",

    "# ans\n",
    "\"\"\" Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression (and other machine learning algorithms) to prevent\n",
    "overfitting, which occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and making it perform\n",
    "poorly on unseen data. Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from \n",

    "\n",
    "Cost = (Original Cost) + (λ * Σ|w_i|)\n",

    "value results in stronger regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization encourages sparse feature selection. It tends to set some of the feature weights to exactly 0,\n",

    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization adds the squared values of the model coefficients to the cost function. The cost function with\n",

    "Regularization helps prevent overfitting by:\n",

    "\n",
    "# ans\n",
    "\"\"\" The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical tool used to evaluate the performance of \n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how the ROC curve is constructed and used to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Thresholds: In binary classification, there is a classification threshold (often set at 0.5 by \n",
    "default) that determines whether an observation is classified as positive (1) or negative (0). Adjusting this \n",
    "threshold can change the model's behavior, affecting the balance between true positives and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive Rate (Sensitivity): The true positive rate (also known as sensitivity or recall) is the proportion\n",
    "of true positive predictions (correctly classified positive examples) to the total number of actual positive \n",
    "examples. It measures how well the model correctly identifies positive instances. The formula for sensitivity is:\n",

    "\n",
    "False Positive Rate = FP / (FP + TN)\n",

    "ROC Curve: To create the ROC curve, the model's sensitivity (true positive rate) is plotted on the y-axis, and the\n",

    "threshold and calculating sensitivity and false positive rate at each threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the model's performance \n",
    "across different classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is a single scalar value that\n",
    "quantifies the overall performance of the model. AUC-ROC ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates better\n",
    "discrimination between positive and negative classes. An AUC-ROC of 0.5 represents a model with no discrimination \n",
    "(similar to random guessing), while an AUC-ROC of 1 represents a perfect classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the ROC Curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ROC curve is closer to the upper-left corner of the plot, it indicates better performance, as the model \n",
    "achieves higher sensitivity (true positive rate) while keeping the false positive rate low.\n",

    "The ROC curve and AUC-ROC provide insights into a logistic regression model's ability to discriminate between \n",
    "positive and negative cases. Here's how it can be used for model evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Comparison: You can compare multiple models by comparing their ROC curves and AUC-ROC values. The model \n",

    "\n",
    "Threshold Selection: Depending on your specific application and goals, you can choose a classification threshold\n",
    "that balances sensitivity and specificity. A more conservative threshold (higher) increases specificity but reduces\n",
